Introduction to Abstraction and Encapsulation


Abstraction is the layer which provide the functionality to hide the internal process.
Encapsulation is about clubbing things below the abstraction layer.

Both Abstraction and Encapsulation co-exists.
Example: Suppose a driver wants to stop the car. 
What that driver would do? Apply the break.
    But the point is does that driver know the internal process for applying the break? Not at all.
    Well this is known as abstraction.
    Again, whatever things were happening inside the car for applying break were working together.
    Well this is known as encapsulation.

Example: Append operation in list.
When we use append append() on list does we know that what's happening inside? No.
Basically here append() acts like layer of abstraction which has been encapsulated in the list class.
